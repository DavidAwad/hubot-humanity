# Hubot Against Humanity

CAH implemented in hubot form. I take no credit for this implementation. I am merely moving this script from the old hubot world to the new NPM-packaged one.

## Usage

Someone types 'hubot q card', and then everyone does 'card me' (or card me 2, if it's a take-two).

## Installation

Add the package 'hubot-humanity' as a dependency in your Hubot package.json file. Then add "hubot-humanity" to the list in the external-scripts.json file.
